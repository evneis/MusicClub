### Firebase Setup

3. Go to Project Settings > Service Accounts
4. Generate a new private key (JSON file)
5. Save the JSON file in your project directory (e.g., `firebase-credentials.json`)

```

For development with auto-restart:

```

## Commands

- `/submit <album> <artist> [link]` - Submit an album for the current month
- `/list` - View all submitted albums for the current month
- `/clear` - Clear all submissions (admin only)

## Firebase Structure

The bot uses the following Firebase Firestore structure:

```
monthly_list/
â”œâ”€â”€ August_2024/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ month: "August"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ year: 2024
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 123456789: "Artist Name;Album Name"
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 987654321: "Another Artist;Another Album"
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lastUpdated: timestamp
â””â”€â”€ September_2024/
    â””â”€â”€ ...
```

- Each month is a document with key format: `Month_Year`
- User submissions are stored as key-value pairs where:
  - Key: Discord User ID
  - Value: `"Artist Name;Album Name"` format
- If a user submits a new album, it overwrites their previous submission

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `DISCORD_TOKEN` | Discord bot token | Yes |
| `CLIENT_ID` | Discord application client ID | Yes |
| `GUILD_ID` | Discord guild ID (for development) | No |
| `FIREBASE_CREDENTIAL` | Path to Firebase service account JSON | Yes |
| `FIREBASE_COLLECTION_PREFIX` | Prefix for Firebase collections (for testing) | No |

## Goals

- âœ… Allow users to submit an album
- âœ… Store all albums and allow users to call a command to view albums
- âœ… Manually clear album data for new months
- ðŸ”„ Lastfm connectivity
- ðŸ”„ Automatic album parsing to retrieve album name and artist name
- ðŸ”„ Automatic retrieval of Spotify and Apple Music links

## Album Links

- Investigate MusicBrainz API for getting links
- Regardless this might still be good for getting metadata (if lastfm doesn't already do it)
